          Baby,<br><br>
          I just want to say thank you. You are the best of me. I am so thankful for you. When I say you are pretty, I mean it. When I say I miss you, I mean it. When I say I love you, I mean it.<br><br>
          I want to apologize about the actions, the words, and the mistakes I have thrown out on you. You don't deserve any of that. You are the best of me so I want to be the best for you.<br><br>
          Thank you for being you. Thank you for being the best partner. Thank you for being the best mom. I love you more than words can express.<br><br>
          Forever yours,<br>
          Jaii
